    ### How to Use The Full App:
    
    When properly set up, this application allows you to:
    
    1. Upload a breast ultrasound image
    2. Select a model architecture from the sidebar
    3. Get a classification prediction (Normal, Benign, or Malignant)
    4. See confidence scores for each class
    5. View a GradCAM visualization highlighting important regions
    
    ### Sample Visualization
